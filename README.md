Hi, I’m Vishwanath Deshmukh, an Apple platform engineering leader.

I have 15+ years of experience architecting and scaling high‑quality consumer platforms across iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and macOS. My work focuses on building the systems behind great Apple experiences: modular Swift frameworks, SwiftUI + UIKit hybrid architectures, performance‑critical concurrency pipelines, and developer‑experience tooling that enables teams to ship reliable products at scale.

I’m also the creator of **Vish Engineering**, an Apple‑first platform architecture system that shows how to build and operate cross‑platform apps with real‑world discipline: layered SDKs (Core → Platform → Feature), protocol‑first boundaries, design tokens, and telemetry‑driven reliability.
