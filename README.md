Hi, I’m Vishwanath Deshmukh - an Apple platform engineering leader.

I have 15+ years of experience architecting and scaling high-quality consumer platforms across iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and macOS. My work focuses on building the systems behind great Apple experiences: modular Swift frameworks, SwiftUI + UIKit hybrid architectures, performance-critical concurrency pipelines, and developer-experience tooling that enables teams to ship reliable products at scale.

I’ve built the Vish Engineering Platform - a public monorepo that demonstrates how Apple-first platform teams can operate with strong architectural discipline at scale.
