Hi, Iâ€™m Vishwanath Deshmukh.

I've been working as an iOS application developer since 2010. I also worked on native Android apps along with hybrid applications. I've developed apps using CoreData, PushNotifications, UIKit and other apple's frameworks. I have great experience in increasing apps perfomrance.

I design apps using **MVVM** and **VIPER** architectures and extensively do **Protocol oriented programming**.
